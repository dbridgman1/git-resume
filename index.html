                    (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://gitresume.bsdadm.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>

                <h4>Website Visitors</h4>
                <p>Like most website operators, Git Resume collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Git Resume's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Git Resume's visitors use its website. From time to time, Git Resume may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>Git Resume also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://gitresume.bsdadm.com blog posts. Git Resume only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

                <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
                <p>Certain visitors to Git Resume's websites choose to interact with Git Resume in ways that require Git Resume to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Git Resume gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://gitresume.bsdadm.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

                <h4>Security</h4>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>


                <h4>Links To External Sites</h4>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

                <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Git Resume may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Git Resume's sole discretion. Git Resume encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
